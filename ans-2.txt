 2. Our client has around 10k linkedin people profiles, he wants to know the estimated income range of these profiles. Suggest ways on how to do this?



ans-2 To deal with the situation the best way is to use Linkedin official API, that will help you to access the user profile data.
In our case 

a) we first have to fetch the company name, industry type and location to estimate the income of the user.

b)Now we have to do some research on the basis of average incomes for specific industries and job roles using industry reports.
 
c)As of now we have collected enough to perform data analysis and visualization to find the income range of these profiles.
